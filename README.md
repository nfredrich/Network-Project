# Network-Project
---
This project is a suite of tools that can be used to analyze a network, target system, or search domain information. 
This suite of tools eliminates the need to memorize complex command line commands and flags, and instead creates a user friendly interactive program that allows even beginners to network analysis, the ability to perform basic tasks.

## The Network and Domain Tools Included in this Project:
1. Retrieve the Local Host Network Information (IP address, MAC address, etc.)  
2. Ping a target system.
3. Traceroute
4. Port Scanner
5. Detect potential spoofed packets (A live scan).  
6. Create an instance of an nmap decoy scan. 
7. Analyze PCAP files recording network traffic packets to determine their source and destination IP addresses. 
8. Generate a pcap file of live network traffic using tcpdump. 
9. Discover the available networks on a target ip address.
10. Send an encrypted message over a TCP tunnel (Client).
11. Receive an encrypted message over a TCP tunnel and decrypt it (Server)
12. Retrieve information regarding a specific domain. 
13. Create a list of subdomains for a requested domain.
